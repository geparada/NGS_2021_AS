Transcriptome guided quantification of isoforms
===============================================

The aim of the analysis of this project is to find differentially included splicing nodes. This can be done three "simple" steps:

    1. Transcriptome indexing 
    2. Quantification
    3. Detection of differentially included nodes


Building a transcriptome index
============================== 

Instead of the classical approach of mapping reads to the genome and then quantify gene expression, Whippet's quantification in performed considering the gene annotation coordinate and features. This are usually stored as a GTF file and Whippet's take these as input to generate transcript models. In order to generate such models, one needs to build an index based on the GTF and Genomic sequences (fasta). This can be achieved by running the following command:


.. admonition:: Challenge 1

    One of the key skills required to learn bioinformatics is to understand the documentation from tools deposited on GitHub or other popular software archives. In order to index the transcriptme using Whippet read the official documentation from Whippet's `GitHub <https://github.com/timbitz/Whippet.jl>`_. What you need to know is on section 2A. Use the files available at ``Data/dm6/``.


.. tip:: ``dm6.ensGene.gtf.gz`` correspond to a GTF file, while ``dm6.fa.gz`` is the `release 6 of <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000001215.4/>`_ `Drosophila melanogaster`'s genome.

.. important:: To execute any of the whippet commands you should locate the ``/bin`` folder inside.

  

Quantifying splicing nodes and transcripts
==========================================

For the quantification step ``bin/whippet-quant.jl`` is used. To find more about this command use:

.. code-block:: bash

    julia bin/whippet-quant.jl --help


For this, one could deduce that the general command to run this step is by using:

.. code-block:: bash

    julia bin/whippet-quant.jl sample.fastq.gz -o out_dir/sample --sam > sample.sam


Where `out_dir/sample` is the base name for the output (five files will be generated) and sample.sam is an optional output that whippets provide when ``--sam`` flag is given.

.. admonition:: Challenge 2

    Apply the general syntax explained above to quantify the 6 samples you downloaded (``.fastq.gz`` files)
