Overview
********

Alternative splicing (AS) is a pivotal step for RNA processing in
higher eukaryotes and it significantly expands the complexity of the
transcriptome. In metazoans AS events are found for most genes, and
they are regulated across developmental stages, tissues and cell-
types. Many different methods have been proposed to study alternative
splicing.  A wide range of computational methods have been proposed to
assess AS using RNA-seq data, however many of these require extensive
computational resources and often struggle to analyse complex AS
events. During this project, you will be introduced to Whippet,
Whippet. (Sterne-Weiler et al. 2018), a light-weight tool developed in
the programming language Julia to reliably analyse AS of any
complexity using RNA-seq data.

The execution of this project will be separated the following
different modules:
   * Setup

   * Indexing transcriptome

   * Splicing node quantification

   * Differential alternative splicing analyses

   * Advanced exercises
